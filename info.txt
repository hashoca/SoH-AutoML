Project: Battery State of Health Estimation using AutoML
Authors: Hasibe Candan Kadem, Onur Kadem
Paper Title: LiCoO2/LiNiCoO2 Battery State of Health (SoH) Estimation Using Automated Machine Learning (AutoML): Performance Comparison

Dataset:
---------
- Name: Oxford Battery Degradation Dataset
- Source: https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:03ba4b01-cfed-46d3-9b1a-7d4a7bdf6fac
- Format: CSV files per battery cell (Cell1 through Cell8)
- Description: Contains voltage, current, temperature measurements and aging information under controlled laboratory conditions.

Code Summary:
--------------
- This repository includes the full implementation of 7 different open-source AutoML frameworks:
    * FLAML
    * TPOT
    * H2O AutoML
    * AutoGluon
    * PyCaret
    * EvalML
    * LazyPredict

- Each framework was executed with:
    * Python 3.8.10
    * A runtime budget of **900 seconds**
    * CPU-only processing (GPU acceleration disabled)
    * Default internal hyperparameter search spaces
    * LOCO (Leave-One-Cell-Out) nested cross-validation

Feature Engineering:
---------------------
- Raw sensor data (voltage, current, temperature) is transformed into the following features:
    * Equivalent Full Cycles (EFC)
    * IC Peak Amplitude (dQ/dV)
    * Mean Operating Temperature
- These features are computed and stored in the `FeatureEngineering/` directory.
